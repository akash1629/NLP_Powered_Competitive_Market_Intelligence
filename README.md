## Overview

- **NLP Pipeline**: spaCy for entity recognition, Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis.
- **Automated Competitive Analysis**: Scans thousands of documents (press releases, reviews, financial statements) to reduce manual research time by **40%**.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Plotly-based charts to show sentiment trends, document counts, and competitor performance over time.
- **Business Impact**: Accelerates strategic decision-making by **25%**â€”executives can quickly identify competitor strategies, user sentiment, and market shifts.

# Contributing to [Project Name]

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Our Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code follows our style guidelines (PEP 8 for Python).
5. Create a Pull Request.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ProjectName.git
   cd ProjectName



## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Explains where data is retrieved (synthetic generation, real CSV, or APIs).
2. **Preprocessing**: Outline cleaning/merging steps, entity matching, feature engineering.
3. **Modeling**:
   - ARIMA vs. Prophet vs. GPT Hybrid in Forecasting project
   - spaCy, Transformers sentiment in NLP project
4. **Optimization** (For Forecasting project):
   - Linear programming approach with cost functions for holding vs. stockout.
5. **Visualizations**:
   - Plotly dashboards or Streamlit apps.

## Future Enhancements

- **Scalability**: Docker containers or Kubernetes deployment.
- **Real GPT Integration**: Replace mock GPT calls with actual OpenAI API usage.
- **Advanced ML**: Incorporate advanced ensembles, Transformer-based time-series forecasting, or multi-modal data analysis.
